### Epilogue

## A better way is possible.

It will take more effort. It won’t be as efficient. It may even cost you more money. However, it could lead to a healthier society of people who aren’t preyed upon by the designs they interact with.

We have a choice to pursue design either with hope or with fear. 

May we always choose *hope*.

Hopeful design teaches us that there are real people in real places existing in real time behind *everything* we create. 

May we design with purpose.
