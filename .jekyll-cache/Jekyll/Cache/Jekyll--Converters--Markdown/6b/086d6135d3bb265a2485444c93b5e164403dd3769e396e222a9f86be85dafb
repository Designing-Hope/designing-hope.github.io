  	<h2>Talk about hope.</h2>
  	<h5>There are topics that we neglect because we feel like they should be assumed. Hope is the foundation, so it‚Äôs well worth mentioning. It‚Äôs OK to tell those you‚Äôre serving that hope is your goal. Speak it into existence.</h5>

  	<h5>Sure, people are messy. They are often hard to understand and even harder to love, but they are who we serve. Whether our design is directly or indirectly serving our audience, we know our design will impact real people. Finding community with others is risky, but its rewards allow us to realize a more complete design vision.</h5>

  	<h2>Embody compassion.</h2>
  	<h5>Though you may serve in the role of designer, you are also someone else‚Äôs user. Allow this to foster empathy that can evolve into active compassion. Design the products you would want to use. Inhabit the lives of others through genuine relationships and design from this new understanding.</h5>

  	<h2>Ask better questions.</h2>
  	<h5>One of the most human things we can do is build community through conversation. Dig for intimate insight through the questions you ask. Don‚Äôt absently inquire but rather actively listen to people and surroundings, allowing your questions to form organically.</h5>
