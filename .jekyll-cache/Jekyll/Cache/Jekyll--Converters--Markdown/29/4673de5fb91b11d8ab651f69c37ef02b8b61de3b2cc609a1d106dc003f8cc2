  	<h2>Talk about hope.</h2>

  	<h5>even harder to love, but they are who we serve. Whether our design is direct or indirectly in serving our audience, we know our design will impact real people. Finding community with others is risky, but its rewards allow us to realize a more complete design vision.</h5>
