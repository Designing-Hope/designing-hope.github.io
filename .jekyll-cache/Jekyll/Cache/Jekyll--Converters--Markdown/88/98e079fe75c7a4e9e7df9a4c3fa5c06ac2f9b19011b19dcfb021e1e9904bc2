  	<em>Designing Hope</em> is a book that explores creating compassionate work for humans.

It‚Äôs equal parts manifesto and practical guide. It strives to rise above technical theory, seeking out practical compassion. In short, if you create things for others <em>(you do)</em>, this book is for you.<br />
