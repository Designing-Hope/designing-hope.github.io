  <p><em>Designing Hope</em> is a book that explores creating compassionate work for humans. It defines a design framework that creates hope by practicing in an ecosystem, honoring that community with its solutions, and sharing in the responsibility of its outcomes. Itâ€™s equal parts manifesto and practical guide. It strives to rise above technical theory, seeking out practical compassion. In short, if you create things for others <em>(you do)</em>, this book is for you.</p>
